# Introduction
The goal of the this document is to prepare the Injury reports for ML/NLP analysis.  This document shows the frequency of the targeted variables or attributes.

Figure 1 shows an overview of suggested process.

We are attempting to test the concept of predicting the attributes of injury reports from the injury's narratives (The textual unstructured description).  This is a supervised learning problem.  The attributes of the injury report are:

- Event
- Source
- Amputation
- Body Part
- Contractor
- Hospitalization
- Nature

The injury narrative's is the predictor (x variable) and the attributes (listed above) are the (Y variable).  

In this folder, there are separate sub folders with the name of the attributes.  Each sub folder has a CSV file.  Each CSV have 3 columns (ID Number - Narratives - The labeled attribute).  The number of reports in each folder is different because we removed all unlabeled data.

# Frequency Analysis 


```{r}
load("E:/Research/Safety Research 2020/Severe Injury_OSHADATA/Datasets/R Project/OSHA_Severe/Final_Prepetation/cons_v2_.RData")

# filter the needed variables

cons_v3 <- cons_v2 %>% 
  select(ID,Final_Narrative, NAICS_L3, NAICS_L4, NAICS_L5,	event_L1,	event_L2,	event_L3,	part_L2,	part_L3,	part_L1,	nature_L1,	nature_L2,	nature_L3,	source1_L1,	source1_L2,	source1_L3,	source2_L1,	source2_L2,	source2_L3,	Hospitalized_Y_N,	Amputation_Y_N)

```

## Event

The number of reports (after excludeing unlabeled reports) is **8,472** reports. The number of categories for *Event* is **7**.

```{r}

cons_event <- cons_v3 %>% 
  select(ID, Final_Narrative, event_L1) %>% 
  mutate(Event = tolower(event_L1) ) %>% 
  filter(Event != "nonclassifiable") 

cons_event_count <- cons_event %>% 
  count(Event, sort = T) %>% 
  mutate(Event_p = ((n*100)/sum(n)))

cons_event_count


# write.csv(cons_event, "Final_Prepetation/cons_event_1.csv", na = "")
```

## Source

The number of reports (after excludeing unlabeled reports) is **8,143** reports. The number of categories for Source is **9**.

```{r}
cons_Source <- cons_v3 %>% 
  select(ID, Final_Narrative, source1_L1) %>% 
  mutate(Source = tolower(source1_L1) ) %>% 
  filter(Source != "nonclassifiable") 

cons_Source %>% 
  count(Source, sort = T) %>% 
   mutate(Source_p = ((n*100)/sum(n)))

# write.csv(cons_Source, "Final_Prepetation/cons_Source.csv", na = "")

```

## Amputation

The number of reports (after excludeing unlabeled reports) is **8,563 ** reports.  This is similar to sentiment analysis in which the Y variable (the response) is either "Yes" or "No".

```{r}
amp <- cons_v3 %>% 
  select(ID,Final_Narrative, Amputation_Y_N)

amp %>% 
  count(Amputation_Y_N, sort = T) %>% 
   mutate(Amputation_p = ((n*100)/sum(n)))

# write.csv(hosp, "Final_Prepetation/amp.csv", na = "")

```

## Body Part
The number of reports (after excludeing unlabeled reports) is **7,897** reports. The number of categories for Source is **6**.

```{r}
# We'll use level 1. We'll merge "Head" with "Neck". 
cons_part <- cons_v3 %>% 
  select(ID, Final_Narrative, part_L1) %>% 
  mutate(Part = tolower(part_L1) ) %>% 
  filter(Part != "nonclassifiable") %>% 
  mutate(Part_v2 = case_when(
    Part == "head" ~ "head and neck",
    Part == "neck, including throat" ~ "head and neck",
    TRUE ~ as.character(Part))) %>% 
  select(-Part,-part_L1)


cons_part %>% 
  count(Part_v2, sort = T) %>% 
   mutate(Part_v2_p = ((n*100)/sum(n)))

# write.csv(cons_part, "Final_Prepetation/cons_part.csv", na = "")

```

## Contractor
The number of reports (after excludeing unlabeled reports) is **8,561** reports. The number of categories for Source is **9**.

```{r}
# the contractor variable
#We'll use level 2 in prediction as an attribute or predictor.

# - We'll use level 2.
# - NAICS_L4  == "Construction" ~ NA_character_ ,
# - NAICS_L4  == "Specialty Trade Contractors" ~ "Other Specialty Trade Contractors",
# - NAICS_L4  == "Land Subdivision" ~ "Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction"
# 
# Discard the two construction cases and do the prediction.
# 
# 

cons_cont <- cons_v3 %>% 
  select(ID, Final_Narrative, NAICS_L4) %>% 
  mutate( Contractor = case_when(
   NAICS_L4  == "Construction" ~ NA_character_ ,
   NAICS_L4  == "Specialty Trade Contractors" ~ "Other Specialty Trade Contractors",
   NAICS_L4  == "Land Subdivision" ~ "Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction",
    TRUE ~ as.character(NAICS_L4)))  %>%

# - We'll call general categories "Other ...."
# - Exclude non-classifiable

```


## Hospitalization

```

## Nature

The number of reports (after excludeing unlabeled reports) is **8,535** reports. The number of categories for Source is **8**.


```{r}
# we'll use level 2 since the majority of cases occurred for TRAUMATIC INJURIES AND DISORDERS with 8535 cases.

# Note: # since the count is small, we'll remove "Other - Nature"
